The Warewulf project is moving its development and community chat to a
dedicated Warewulf Slack workspace at
[warewulf.slack.com](https://warewulf.slack.com). If you're not already a
member, you can [join here][1] or find an invite link at
[warewulf.org/help](/help).

The new Slack workspace has channels for development, organization, help, and
general discussion. There's even a `warewulf3` channel for people who haven't
moved to Warewulf v4 yet. And don't forget to stop by `#introductions` to tell
us all about yourself and how you're using Warewulf!

We hope to see you there soon!
